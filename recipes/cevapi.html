<p>Cevapi are easy to make, grilled sausages from Southeastern Europe that burst with smoky flavor and are perfect for serving with flatbread and sliced onions.</p>
<br>
<p>Cevapi (or cevapici) originated in the Balkans during the time of Turkish rule (the Ottoman Empire).

    You can see the Turkish influence in the similarity of cevapi to a Turkish kofta kebab, which is a mixed-meat sausage that is molded onto skewers for easy grilling. </p>
